## Preview

### Start page

When you connect, this screen will appear, with instructions to start the game.

![Start page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ce84898-1ab6-41e6-ab6a-2b50ad7621a0)

The image is an edited version of a warning screen users would see when launching a game on Wii Systems. Whilst it is a parody image, it is a true and appropriate warning that you need to be careful when playing, as to not hit anyone, nor drop your phone.

You then need to follow the instructions on your phone to select the player count, player names, and the map you'd like to play on.

After a second or so of loading, the game will start!

### Gameplay

When the game looks like this, it's waiting for the player's input, being throwing the ball onto the pins.

When you do throw the ball, you'll see it rolling towards the pins, like this.

If you aim correctly, the ball will hit the pins, like this.

Once you hit the pins, a video will play, just like those bowling alley animations.

The video played depends on how many pins you hit. For example, if you hit 8 pins and get a split, the selected video will match appropriately.

Same thing for a strike.

As well as gutters.

After the video ends, the ball will automatically roll back towards the player, which indicates they must roll again.

The scoreboard will also update once the ball comes back. The name highlighted in purple is the current player, as well as the current round. Make sure to pass around the controller when it's someone else's turn.

When the game ends, the final score is calculated and the winner is declared. Because the demo here features 4 rounds, instead of the usual 10, the score is lower than you'd expect.

Once you finish, you can start a new match in the phone app.

### Maps

There are multiple maps you can choose from when playing the game. Here are a few examples :
