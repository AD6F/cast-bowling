The image is an edited version of a warning screen users would see when launching a game on Wii Systems. Whilst it is a parody image, it is a true and appropriate warning that you need to be careful when playing, as to not hit anyone, nor drop your phone.

You then need to follow the instructions on your phone to select the player count, player names, and the map you'd like to play on.

You'll then see this loading screen here.
